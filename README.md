# macd
#### These are series of algorithmic trading systems (completed and currently in-progress)

### Indicators used:
* Stochastics
* MACD
* Standard Deviation

The idea behind the algorithm:
During calibration an appropriate threshold level on a MACD indicator is established. Limit orders in an opposite direction are placed when the indicator breaches threshold level. These orders are placed with increasing leverage betting on the probability of currency  being overbought/oversold at these levels.

Source files need to be compiled with MetaEditor and the strategy can be executed in MetaTrader on any timeframe with an account balance of up to $100,000.00

Performance analysis can be assessed from reports in MACD(6,30,1) -> Forwardtesting folder
